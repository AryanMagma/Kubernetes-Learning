Containerized Applications
Software applications are typically deployed as a single set of libraries and configuration files to a runtime environment. They are traditionally deployed to an operating system with a set of services running, such as a database server or an HTTP server, but they can also be deployed to any environment that can provide the same services, such as a virtual machine or a physical host.
